The EuroHiker module is based on the popular (Linux) Unihiker single board computer by [DFRobot](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-2691.html)

The UniHiker board comes standard with WiFi/Bluetooth, Light Sensor, Microphone, Accelerometer sensor, Gyroscope sensor, Buzzer, MicroSD card slot and Various I/O connectivity (PWM, ADC, I2C, UART, USB, SPI)

The EuroHiker module adds to this already impressive list of features MIDI IN/OUT, Gate IN/OUT, Control Voltage IN/OUT, two push buttons, a Rotary Encoder with built in Red/Green/Blue LEDs plus another push button. The module also has an ON/OFF switch - and last but not least, offers an expansion interface (26pins) for you to experiment and interact with the EuroHiker module through your own desgins!

The EuroHiker module is designed to provide a programmable platform capable of executing various functions, fitting seamlessly into the world of EuroRack where modules are typically fine-tuned to excel in their designated tasks.

The EuroHiker module, on the other hand, empowers you to navigate through folders containing Python programs, each leveraging the module's extensive feature set.

The idea is to have the flexibility to explore numerous concepts, allowing you to test them before deciding whether to further develop them using another development board or to retain them with
